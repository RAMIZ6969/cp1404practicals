# CP1404 Practical Exercises Repository

## Repository Overview
Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals repository. This repo includes practical exercises and projects that demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques covered in the CP1404 subject.

## About Me
I'm Mohammad Ramiz Karim, and this repository showcases my journey through the CP1404 subject as I learn and apply principles of clean code, programming patterns, and software development best practices.

## Key Lessons on Clean Code
- Readability and Simplicity: Clear and simple code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain. This involves using meaningful names, organizing code logically, and following conventions.
- Avoiding Redundancy (DRY Principle): Redundant code increases the chances of errors and inconsistencies. I learned to use functions and classes effectively to avoid repetition.
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each function or class should have a single responsibility, making the code modular, easier to test, and more adaptable to changes.
