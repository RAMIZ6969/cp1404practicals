# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were often not very accurate, especially at the beginning. I tended to underestimate the time it would 
take to complete tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I got better at predicting how long tasks would take. As I gained more experience, 
I learned to consider all the details and challenges before estimating.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that making estimates requires careful consideration of all the steps involved. 
It is important to account for challenges that might arise and not just the obvious tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learned the importance of reading others' feedback carefully. It helped me identify mistakes 
I might not have noticed and improve my code quality.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

When reviewing others' code, I learned to focus on both the functionality and the readability of the code.
I also realized that constructive feedback is essential for helping others improve.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

Same as the above one. Basic requirements missing.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would avoid putting the solutions in the github repo and discuss it only when the students come to get their prac 
checked.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Submitting it on time and keeping a consistent grade.
