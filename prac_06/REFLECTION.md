# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Putting more time into lectures videos and lecture slides.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Relying too much on solutions instead of trying to overcame complicated situations alone.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Submitting practicals/online tests/assessments on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Relying on solutions and procrastination.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Subject is very well coordinated. I think instead of watching lecture videos before seminar,
the main teachings should be taught during the seminars so more student can be present and focus at the same time.
